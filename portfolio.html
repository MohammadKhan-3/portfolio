			<h3>Accessible Prosthetics Initiative</h3>  <!--This is when you click on the work & read more about it -->
			<time datetime="2019-01-09">From 01/09/19 - Present</time>
			<p>Visit us at our Website: <a href="https://u.osu.edu/ohiostateapi/">Accessible Prosthetics Initiative</a> <br>Valueable Skills Learned: Leadership, 3D printing  ,Communication, Teamwork<br>The Accessible Prosthetics Initiative (API) is a pending 501(c)(3) organization that believes prosthetics should be available to those who need them. API tackles this goal in a holistic manner through community outreach and education about open-source 3D-printed prosthetics, connecting amputees to resources in their area, and distributing 3D Printed prosthetics. Our mission is to create a self-sufficient community that is able to not only produce their prosthetics as they need it, but also have access to vital resources such as support groups and prosthetic clinics. </p>

				For my senior year at Hilliard Davidson High School, I worked with one other person to develop an assistive device for the special educaiton students. This project was in conjunction with Engineering Design & Development, the final course in the Project Lead the Way curriculum. In the project, we developed a cart to help the special education students lift heavy objects. Many of the special-ed students at physical handicaps, and many worked janitorial jobs at Davidson. The cart alleviated any phsyical strain of carrying heavy objects such as buckets of water, mops, trash bags, and others throughout the lunch room. We built a prototype out of wood and bought a cart off of Amazon and made the appropriate modifcations to it before giving them the cart.</p>

				The purpose was the build an affordable cellphone gimbal with 3-axis stabilization and joystick control using entirely Arduino components. Due to the COVID pandemic, I was unable to physical build the model, however, I could test the component functionality. The total cost of the 3-axis stabilization gimbal with joystick operation was $40 which is relatively affordable compared to the $90-100 counterparts.</p>

			<h3>The Use of Soft Magnetic Actuator in Medical Intubation</h3>

				<br>Valueable Skills Learned: Initiative, Reserach, Patent Research, Medical Devices, Soft Robotics<br>
				The aim of the project was improving the accuracy of medical intubation-the process of placing a breathing tube to into the throat of a patient to pump air into their lungs- using soft magnetic robots. The robots were made of an elastomer and were actuated by magnetic fields.<br>During medical intubation, the breathing tube can go into the esophagus instead of the trachea and manytimes medical professionals are performing intubation in a moving ambulance, so mistakes are common. My design, when performed on a medical mannequin, produced a 90% success rate of entering the trachea rather than the esophagus.</p>

			<h3>Buckeye Leadership Fellows: Mid-Ohio Food Collective</h3>
			<time datetime="2014-06-20">Completed: 07/22/2020</time>
			<p><br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I8UgOKvICL_-w_n2GojFTpLWfAV0V626/view?usp=sharing">Link to Mid-Ohio Food Collective Presentation</a><br>Valueable Skills Learned: Failure Analysis, Leadership, Consulting, Research<br>Through the Buckeye Leadership Fellows program, I lead a team of 3 other students on a consulting project involving the Mid-Ohio Food Collective (MOFC). The aim of the project was to provide reccomendations on how MOFC could retain their current volunteer force and reach out to new volunteers amid the COVID pandemic. <br>After weeks of research, my team and I provided 3 reccomendations that utilizes Ohio State University's vast and diverse student population.<br>
			This project challenged me as a leader. Two of my teammates experienced dire personal circumstances and stepped away from the project leaving me and one other person to finish the project. Though we had provided 3 good reccomendations, we did not provide the right reccomendations.<br> The 3 reccomendations we provided were long-term solutions that would prevent MOFC from ever having large volunteer issues again, but that does not solve the current problem. <br> I failed as a leader because I was stuck thinking long-term when I should have thought about the current issue at hand with less focus on long-term solutions. This experienced taught me the value of thinking both long-term and short-term, and how we must solve the short-term problems quickly so that we can create long-term solutions.</p>

			Translating Enginering to K-8 (TEK8) program at Ohio State University takes engineering concepts learned in the research lab and teaches them to elementary and middle school students.<br>I took my research from the Soft Intelligent Materials Laboratory and created a design challenge for KIPP Academy elementary and middle school students. The challenge was taking a complex topic and breaking into something the students could understand. I took the topic of actuators and built a design challenge based on actuators. Breaking the concept of actuators into simple topics and relating them to everyday objects was key for the elementary and middle school students to understand properly.</p>

			Link to poster of Prosthetic Pylong Project</a><br><br>Valueable Skills Learned: Solidworks, Finite Element Analysis, Research<br>
			For my Mechanics of Materials course at The Ohio State University, I worked on a team that looked at the stress developed in the pylon of the prosthetic leg. We used different metals and analyzed the deformation, cost, strength, and weight of the pylon. Out of the 3 designs we tested, we found the composite cylinder to be the most optimal in terms of strength and cost.
